This card accompanies the training syllabus for this tool, and should be filled in by an instructor authorised to give training for this tool. They will record your progress for each topic as follows:

\vspace{0.5em}
\begin{tabular}{ c l l }
\textbf{D} & -- & Topic introduced/demonstrated by instructor. \\
\textbf{1} & -- & First attempt at exercise by trainee. \\
\textbf{2} & -- & Exercise completed by trainee with assistance. \\
\textbf{3} & -- & Exercise completed by trainee, further practice needed. \\
\textbf{S} & -- & Trainee at satisfactory standard for this topic. \\
\end{tabular}
\vspace{0.5em}

When all topics in a section have been covered, and you have been evaluated for that section, an instructor will sign next to the section heading. When all sections have been signed off, you will have successfully completed this training program, and should sign at the bottom of this page.
