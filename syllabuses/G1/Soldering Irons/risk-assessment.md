# Soldering Irons

## Burn due to hot-end of soldering iron

### Severity

L

### Likelihood

L

### Who may be harmed & how

- User - the user may have a minor burn due to the high temperature of the hot-end of the soldering iron

### Control measures

- Signage - standard "hot surface" signage is used to indicate the surface may be hot
- Training - informing the user about how to tell if the soldering iron is currently operating and to avoid touching the
  hot-end directly. awareness that heat is conducted through metal materials commonly used during
  soldering.
- Equipment - first aid kit is available

## Fire started due to hot-end of soldering iron

### Severity

H

### Likelihood

L

### Who may be harmed & how

- The space - the equipment and surrounding area may become damaged from a fire started by a flammable material placed
  on the hot-end of the soldering iron.
- User - the user may become injured from a fire by both heat and inhalation of smoke
- Bystanders - bystanders may become injured by both heat and inhalation of smoke

### Control measures

- Signage - standard "hot surface" signage is used to indicate the surface may be hot
- Training - users are instructed to not leave flammable materials on or around the soldering iron
- Supervision - hot soldering irons are not left unattended
- Equipment - fire alarms and extinguishers are installed, first aid kit is available

## Hazardous gasses

### Severity

M

### Likelihood

L

### Who may be harmed & how

- Users of the room - anyone in the room may sustain injury from inhalation or contact with eyes of hazardous gasses
  produced by soldering substrates

### Control measures

- Extraction - an extraction device is used to extract hazardous gasses from work area
- Training - users are informed about substrates producing hazardous gasses and instructed to use an extraction device
  and appropriate PPE
- Equipment - users are required to wear appropriate eye protection, eyewash kit is available

## Heated debris hitting user

### Severity

H

### Likelihood

L

### Who may be harmed & how

- User - some components and substrates may overheat during prolonged contact with the soldering iron and result in a
  small explosion which may propel hot debris towards the user potentially hitting their eyes or other body parts resulting
  in loss of or damage to vision or burns

### Control measures

- Training - awareness of heat sensitive components and necessity to solder quickly and carefully
- Equipment - users are required to wear appropriate eye protection, eyewash and first aid kits are available
