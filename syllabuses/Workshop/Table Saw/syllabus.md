# Table Saw

## Safety

### PPE

* Safety glasses required
* Hearing protection required
* Respirator recommended

### Entanglement risks

* No loose clothing or cables
* No gloves
* Long hair must be tied back
* No jewellery/watches

### Kickback risks

* Ensure riving knife is properly installed:
  * The radial clearance between saw blade and riving knife
may not exceed 5 mm (max.).
  * The thickness of the riving knife must be smaller than the
cutting width and greater than the blade thickness.
  * The riving knife must always be in a line to the saw blade.
* Stand with torso away from the cut line.
* Ensure the full length of the workpiece is in contact with the parallel guide while cutting.
* Always use an angle guide when cross-cutting.
* Never back stock off blade.
* If the saw blade should become jammed, switch the machine off and hold the workpiece until the saw blade comes to a complete stop. To prevent kickback, the workpiece may not be moved until after the machine has come to a complete stop.


## Startup checks

### Surrounding area cleared of obstacles

### Other workshop users alerted to keep clear, and to use appropriate PPE

### Table clear of objects

### The insert-plate in place and undamaged

### Blade, blade guard, and riving knife set up correctly

* Power off when performing checks
* Aligned correctly
* All adjustments tightened
   * Pay particular attention to the position of the locking lever for locking the saw blade and for adjusting the bevel angle.
* Always adjust the blade guard in such a manner that it faces loosely against the workpiece when
sawing.
* Blade guard does not interfere with the workpiece
* No damage to blade
* Blade can be spun freely
* Adjust blade height by turning the crank until upper saw teeth are ~ 5mm above the workpiece.

### Workpiece free of any metals (nails, screws), glass etc.

### Workpiece has a straight factory edge aligned to the parallel guide
 * Do not saw warped/bent workpieces.

### Wide workpieces must be underlaid or supported at their free end.
* Check manual on how to pull out the saw-table extension.

### For very long pieces, use an extra support roller or someone to bear the stock.
* The “off bearer” is only there to support stock and should not pull stock through stock.

## Usage

### Starting of the machine

* Turn on the extractor wall fan.
* Turn on the dust extraction unit under the table saw.
* Tap your tag on the access control
* Open the yellow switch cover, and press the green button.

### Stopping of the machine

* Open the switch cover, and press the red button.

### Sawing straight cuts

* Set the parallel guide at desired distance and lock it in place.

* Use push sticks and auxiliary guide when cutting narrow pieces (10cm rule of thumb)
  * Have push sticks ready before starting the cut.
  * Check manual on how to install auxiliary guide.

* Saw by feeding the workpiece at a uniform rate
* Ensure that the flat edge of the workpiece must always be touching the parallel guide.
* Push stock completely past the back side of the blade.


### Sawing Mitre Angles

* Adjust the requested mitre angle
* Place the workpiece against profile rail.
  * The profile may not be on the cutting line. If so, loosen knurled nut and move the profile.

* With one hand, press the workpiece against the profile rail and with the other hand, slowly move the angle stop via locking knob toward the front in guide groove.

### General

* Never saw freehand
* Never clear small pieces while blade is moving
* Never adjust blade height, angle, or any other parts while blade is moving
* Keep hands away from blade (never reach across the blade, or over-reach)
* Use of push sticks is a must if hand will come closer than 10 cm to the blade.
* To ensure the workpiece is in contact with the parallel guide, the force exerted on the workpiece should be at a slight angle toward the fence (as opposed to purely parallel to the blade).
  * One tip is to focus where the workpiece is with respect to the parallel guide, rather than the blade (while keeping awareness of the blade!).

### Intended Use (a.k.a Materials)


* The power tool is intended as a stationary machine for making
straight lengthways and crossways cuts in hard and softwood, as well as in particle and fibre board.
* In this, mitre angles from –60° to +60° as well as bevel angles from –2° to 47° are possible.
* When using appropriate saw blades, sawing aluminium profiles and plastic is also possible.
* Maximum Workpiece Dimensions:
  - 79mm at 0° bevel angle
  - 56mm at 45° bevel angle

### Post Cutting

* Once you have finished your cut, turn off the table saw, log out of the access control, and clean up the table saw and the surrounding area.
* Place the angle guide back in its place.
* Place the push-sticks back in their place.
* Fully lower the blade
* Turn off the dust extraction unit.

## Maintenance

### General

* If there are any issues, please contact a maintainer listed on the table saw wiki page. Example issues: damaged blade, terrible noises from moving parts.
* Do not attempt to change the blade without a maintainer present, and notify the other members if the blade is intended for specific materials only.
