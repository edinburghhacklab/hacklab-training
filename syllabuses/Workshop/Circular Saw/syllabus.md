# Handheld Circular Saw

## Safety

### PPE

* Safety glasses required
* Hearing protection required
* Respirator recommended when cutting treated wood or producing fine dust

### Entanglement risks

* No loose clothing or cables
* No gloves
* Long hair must be tied back
* No jewellery/watches

### Kickback risks

* Always hold the saw firmly with both hands
* Allow the saw to reach full speed before beginning a cut
* Never start the saw with the blade in contact with the workpiece
* Always support workpiece so the kerf does not close up behind the blade
* Avoid binding by allowing the cut-off to fall freely or be supported
* Never remove or disable the lower blade guard
* If the blade becomes jammed, release the trigger immediately and hold the saw in place until the blade stops

## Startup checks

### Surrounding area cleared of obstacles

### Other workshop users alerted to keep clear and use appropriate PPE

### Blade and guard condition checked

* Power off and remove battery when performing checks
* Blade is sharp and undamaged
* Blade is installed correctly, tightened, and rotates freely
* Blade guard moves freely and returns to cover blade automatically

### Check for correct blade type

* Use appropriate blade for material (wood, plastic, etc.)
* Do not use dull, damaged, or inappropriate blades

### Workpiece free of metals (nails, screws) etc.

### Stable cutting surface

* Workpiece secured using clamps or bench
* Ensure both sides of the cut are supported to prevent binding

## Usage

### Starting the machine

* Position saw with blade clear of workpiece
* Hold securely with both hands
* Press safety switch and trigger to start
* Allow blade to reach full speed before contacting workpiece

### Stopping the machine

* Release trigger to stop blade
* Keep hands on saw and wait for blade to stop fully before setting it down
* Do not set the saw down on its side or while blade is still spinning

### Making straight cuts

* Mark cut line clearly
* Align blade to cut line using notch or guide
* Hold the front and rear handles with a firm grip
* Keep baseplate flat on the workpiece throughout the cut
* Feed saw steadily along the line, do not force
* Let the blade do the cutting
* Always cut on a stable surface, with workpiece clamped

### Bevel and plunge cuts

* Adjust bevel angle as needed and tighten adjustment knob
* For plunge cuts:
  * Check manual for correct plunge technique
  * Begin with front of baseplate in contact with workpiece
  * Pivot saw down slowly until blade enters the material
  * Do not plunge into hidden voids, knots, or metal

### General

* Never saw freehand without guiding edge or clear markings
* Never bypass the safety mechanisms
* Never adjust the bevel, depth, or blade while running
* Maintain a balanced stance, do not overreach
* Keep both hands on the saw at all times during cutting
* Always let the saw come to a complete stop before removing it from the cut

### Intended Use (appropriate materials)

* The handheld circular saw is designed for straight cuts in wood and sheet materials
* Can be used for plastics and soft metals (e.g. aluminium) with appropriate blade
* Not intended for cutting masonry, tile, or hardened metals
* Typical max cutting depth (guideline):
  - ~55mm at 90°
  - ~40mm at 45°

## Post Cutting

* Remove battery
* Clean the area of sawdust and offcuts
* Remove and store clamps and guides
* Allow blade to cool before inspecting or changing
* Return saw to storage with blade guard locked in place

## Maintenance
