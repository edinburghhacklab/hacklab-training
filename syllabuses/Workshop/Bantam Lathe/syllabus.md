# Bantam Lathe

<!-- There is no prescribed structure, but here is a suggestion: -->

## Safety

### PPE
- Safety glasses required.
- Hearing protection optional.

### Risks

#### Entangling risks
- No loose clothing.
- No loose jewellery (i.e. rings, watches) or accessories (i.e. cables).
- No gloves.
- Long hair must be tied back.

#### Stock, swarf and chip risks
- Wood or flammable metals (magnesium, titanium) dust and swarf must be immediately cleaned up.
- Sharp chips may fly.
- Stock, workpieces, and tools may all have sharp edges.
- Stock and workpiece may become very hot during cutting.

<!-- Usually, all of the control measures in the risk assessment should be mentioned here -->
## Anatomy of the lathe
- Headstock is where the part is turned from.
- Bed is the portion which moves when you turn the big wheel.
    - Slides are mounted on the bed and controlled by little wheels.
- Tailstock is the piece at the far end, used for securing work or for drilling.
- Z axis is parallel to the work.
- X axis is perpendicular to the work.
- Autofeed knob
- Fwd/reverse knob
- Thread-cutting levers
    - TODO: Document how these actually work
        - TODO: Figure out how these work.

## Startup checks
### Surrounding area cleared of obstacles.

### Other workshop users alerted to keep clear.

### Stock is secured in chuck and all jaws are tight.
- The three-jaw chuck should be used for round stock. The four-jaw chuck should be used for all other shapes.
- Unlike the four-jaw chuck, the jaws on the three-jaw chuck are mechanically linked. Regardless, all three sockets should be tightened.

### The key is removed from the chuck and the chuckguard is down.

### The tool being used is securely attached to the toolpost.

### Table and tool feeds are disengaged.

### Machine is in correct gear.
- The speed figures are not actually correct, but they are correct relative to each other.
- The gear should only ever be changed when the lathe is turned off and is stationary.
- Once a gear is selected, the chuck should be manually rotated a full turn to ensure smooth movement.

### The table is clear of the workpiece.

## Usage

### Starting the machine
- Check lathe is in gear and rotate headstock.
- Disengage the emergency stop.
- Press the red stop button on the lathe.
- Press the green start button next to the VFD and wait for the tool controller to turn on.
- Tap in.
- Press "Fwd."
- Keep foot on or near brake at all times.

### Loading and Unloading Tools
- Lock toolholder in table
- Verify height of tool
    - Close chuck jaws and bring cutter to near centre
    - Tool should be in line with centre of chuck

### Changing Chuck
- Move each of the sockets until the mark on the socket lines up with the mark on the body.
- Carefully lift chuck off
- Load new chuck and carefully tighten each socket.

### Stopping the machine
- Press the red stop button on the lathe.
- Press the red button next to the VFD.
- Log out.
- Press in the e-stop.

<!-- incl estops if necessary -->


### Materials
- Metals are fine
- Wood can be turned, provided very low speeds are used and all dust and swarf is removed immediately.
- Flammable metals (titanium, magnesium, et al) must be turned at very low speeds with coolant, and all dust and swarf should be removed immediately.
