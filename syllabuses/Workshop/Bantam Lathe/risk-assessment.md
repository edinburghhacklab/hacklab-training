## Entanglement

### Severity

H

### Likelihood

L

### Risk rating

M

### Who may be harmed & how

Lathe users and bystanders
<!-- Usually some combination of:
       User
       Bystander
       Users of the room
       The space
       Following user -->

### Control measures

Loose clothing, jewellry and accessories to be removed. Gloves not to be worn. Long hair to be tied back. Chuck guard must be lowered when machine is in operation.

## Flying parts

### Severity

<!-- How bad it is if the thing happens. H, M, or L. -->
H

### Likelihood

<!-- How likely something is, *after* the control measures listed below. H, M, or L. -->
L

### Risk rating

<!-- If both likelihood and severity are H, this is H
     If one of likelihood and severity is L, and the other is L or M, this is L
     Otherwise, this is M -->
M

### Who may be harmed & how

Lathe users, bystanders, users of the room, and the space

### Control measures

The lathe should not be started until the user has confirmed that the workpiece and tool are properly secured, the chuck key is removed, and the work area and machine ways are completely cleared. The chuck guard should be lowered when running the lathe. The cam pins securing the chuck to the headstock spindle shoud be carefully inspected.

## Contact with moving machinery

### Severity

<!-- How bad it is if the thing happens. H, M, or L. -->
H

### Likelihood

<!-- How likely something is, *after* the control measures listed below. H, M, or L. -->
L

### Risk rating

<!-- If both likelihood and severity are H, this is H
     If one of likelihood and severity is L, and the other is L or M, this is L
     Otherwise, this is M -->
M

### Who may be harmed & how

Lathe users and bystanders

### Control measures
The user must never touch rotating machinery or workpieces. The chuck guard must be lowered when the lathe is in operation.

## Contact with swarf

### Severity

<!-- How bad it is if the thing happens. H, M, or L. -->
M

### Likelihood

<!-- How likely something is, *after* the control measures listed below. H, M, or L. -->
M

### Risk rating

     Otherwise, this is M -->
M

### Who may be harmed & how
Lathe users and bystanders.

### Control measures
Swarf ribbons should be handled with tools (such as needlenose pliers, a brush, or a shop vacuum). Swarf should not be cleared while the machine is in operation due to risk of entanglement. Eye protection and - if appropriate - a respirator should be worn to protect against swarf.
