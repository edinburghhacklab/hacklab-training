# Planer-Thicknesser

<!-- There is no prescribed structure, but here is a suggestion: -->

## Safety

### PPE
* Safety glasses required
* Hearing protection required
* Respirator recommended

### Risks
* The tool will pull material into it. Keep a light grip of your material and be prepared to release it immediately.
* Long hair must be tied back.
* No loose clothing or cables.
* No loose jewellery or watches.
* No gloves.

<!-- Usually, all of the control measures in the risk assessment should be mentioned here -->

## Startup checks

### Surrounding area cleared of obstacles
* You will need space greater than the length of the material on *both* sides of the tool.
* Ensure that other users do not need to pass the tool while it is in use.

### Tool clear of objects

### Table wheels locked

### Cutters are raised high enough that material can pass through easily when tool is off
* The cutters should remove at most 0.16" **TODO: CHECK** per pass.

## Usage

### Starting the machine
* Ensure the main ventilation fan is running.
* Tap your tag on the access control box.
* Release the E-stop.
* Press the switch to start the motor.

### Stopping the machine
* The E-stop should only be used in emergencies.
* Ordinarily, the machine should be switched off using the power switch.
* Remember to log out if leaving the machine unattended.

<!-- incl estops if necessary -->

### General
* Keep the workpiece straight as it passes through the tool.
* Slowly press material into the tool until it grips and begins pulling.
    * Keep a loose grip on the material - be aware that it may 'pull' or 'buck' and this should not be fought.
    * When the tool begins pulling material through, stop pushing and keep it straight.
* Monitor the cut depth indicator to ensure it does not rise to dangerous levels **TODO: WHAT DO IF DOES?**
* If the material overhangs the tool by a significant amount, ask for another member's help to hold it as it emerges from the far side of the machine.
* Do not allow your hands to enter the metal "roller table" at any point while the machine is powered on.
* Decrease the cutting height by an amount between half and two-thirds of the safe maximum (to account for variability in the surface height.)

### Materials
* Only wood can be used with the planer-thicknesser.
* Soft woods can have more material removed at once than hard woods.
* The side of the material opposite the side being planed or thicknessed must be flat enough that the workpiece is stable.

### Cleaning up
* Turn off the tool and depress the E-stop. Log out of access control.
* Hoover up any dust which may have accumulated.

## Maintenance

### General
* Contact tools@edinburghhacklab.com if the machine does not operate as expected.
