# Sander

## Safety
### PPE
 * Safety glasses required.
 * Mask/respirator and hearing protection strongly recommended.

### Entanglement risks
 * No loose clothing or cables.
 * No gloves.
 * Long hair must be tied back.
 * Fingers must be kept at least 10cm away from moving parts.
 * Particular care must be taken around the gap where the belt disappears.

## Startup checks
### Surrounding area cleared of obstacles
### Other workshop users alerted to keep clear
### Belt/table clear of objects
### Belt aligned correctly
 * Must be centered on the contact wheel (between the brass knobs).

### All adjustments tightened
### No damage to belt/disc
### Machine can manually be spun freely
 * Belt must stay aligned when spinning the sander manually.

### Dust extraction
 * Dust extraction must be used when using the sander
 * The dust extractor should turn on automatically when scanning into the machine. If it doesn't come on automatically, it should be turned on manually with the button on the front of the dust extractor.

## Usage
### General
 * Hold workpiece tight, but only press it lightly into the abrasive.
 * Only work on pieces you can safely hold by yourself. If it's too large, cut it down to a manageable size first. If the workpiece is too small to safely hold, sand it by hand.
 * Only use disc on downward (right-hand) side. Workpiece must be pushed into the table, not upwards and away from it.
 * When using the horizontal belt sander, always sand so that the belt motion is away from you.
 * Keep work in contact with table or stops. Do not freehand above the surface. Elevated parts can grab and pull your fingers towards the abrasive.
 * Do not leave the machine running unattended.
 * Have a wide/stable stance and not lean over the sander.
 * Don't stand in line with the rotation of the sander.
 * Be aware that the workpiece may grab and pull the user in, or be flung away. Use the stops and table to prevent this.

 ### Cleanup
* After sanding as a matter of courtesy to other members, please do the following;
    * Use the rubber block on the sander to clean up the surface of the belt/disc
    * Vacuum up any dust that the extraction didn't get
    * Log out of the sander access control
    * Return your safety glasses and hearing protection to their correct storage location

## Maintenance
### General
 * If there are any issues, please contact a maintainer listed on the Sander wiki page. Example issues: frayed/torn/damaged belt or disc, main belt out of alignment or terrible noises from moving parts.
