# Bandsaw

## Safety

### PPE

* Safety glasses required
* Hearing protection recommended (especially when cutting metals) 

### Entanglement risks

* No loose clothing or cables
* No loose jewellery (e.g. watches)
* No gloves
* Long hair must be tied back

## Startup checks

### Surrounding area cleared of obstacles

### Other workshop users alerted to keep clear

* Make sure there are no users that would be at risk of accidentally knocking you while the bandsaw is in operation

### Table clear of objects

### Blade set up correctly

* Aligned correctly
  * Remember to check that the blade isn't contacting the rollers either side causing them to spin
* All adjustments tightened
* Guard for blade locked into place, set as low as possible
* No damage to blade
* Machine can manually be spun freely
  * Power off the machine before checking this
  * Open the front door, spin the blade by hand to check it runs freely
  * Blade must stay aligned when spinning manually
* Remind the trainee that they **should not** start a cut if they are not comfortable with how the machine is set up. Instead, they should contact the maintainers (tools@edinburghhacklab.com / wiki)

### Speed

* The bandsaw can run at different speeds for different materials
* The speed is changed by adjusting the belt and gearbox position in the rear compartment
* Check the speed and belt/gearbox positions and consult the wiki page for a table of settings for different materials
* Close both doors after changing speed
* Trainees should never assume the speed is correctly set for the material they are about to cut - check every time they start a session

## Usage

### Starting of the machine

* Ensure the main ventilation fan is running (especially important for wood)
* Tap your tag on the access control
* Release the E-Stop
* Press the green button on the contactor
  * Wait for the VFD to start (a while)
* Press the green button on the bandsaw to start the motor

### Stopping of the machine

* Both the foot switch and the red button on the bandsaw will cause a VFD stop, and should be used in most situations
* The E-stop should be pressed in an emergency, this will cut power to the bandsaw
* Remember to log out if leaving the machine unattended for any period of time

### General

* Keep your hands a reasonable distance away from the blade i.e. at least 3-4cm
* Particular care must be taken around the gap where the blade disappears
* Hold workpiece tight, pressing the workpiece firmly into the table, push at a steady rate through the blade
* Only work on pieces you can safely hold by yourself. If it's too large, ask for another member's help to hold the material
* Keep your hands out of the cutline at all times
* Keep work in contact with table or stops. Do not freehand above the surface. Elevated parts will be grabbed by the blade
* Make sure the workpiece is supported e.g. pieces with overhangs or circular pieces
* Don't force the blade to cut a small radius curve. If this is required make it with multiple small cuts
* Never back out of a radius cut while the machine is running
* Do not leave the machine running unattended
* Have a wide/stable stance
* If the workpiece gets stuck in the blade, stop the machine and gently remove the piece

### Materials

* Acceptable materials include:
  * Wood
  * Aluminium
  * Mild steel
  * Copper
  * Plastic
* Unacceptable materials include:
  * Stainless steel
  * Hardened steel
* Consult the complete list of materials on the wiki page
* Ask a maintainer if you are unsure of suitability

### Post Cutting

* Once you have finished your cut, turn off the bandsaw, log out of the access control, and clean up the table
* Leave the machine in the state you would expect to find it

## Maintenance

### General

* Contact tools@edinburghhacklab.com if anything seems amiss with the saw.
* Common issues include:
  * Damage to the blade
  * Blade out of alignment/not running true
  * Grinding/squeaking/etc noises from moving parts

## Other

* The table can tilt but as we do not yet have suitable stops, this table shall stay flat
