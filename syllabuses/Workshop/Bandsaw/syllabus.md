## Usage

### Starting of the machine

* Tap your tag on the access control
* Release the E-Stop
* Press the green button on the contactor
  * Wait for the VFD to start (a while)
* Press the green button on the bandsaw to start the motor

### Stopping of the machine

* Both the foot switch and the red button on the bandsaw will cause a VFD stop, and should be used in most situations
* The E-stop should be pressed in an emergency, this will cut power to the bandsaw

### General

* Keep your hands a reasonable distance away from the blade i.e. at least 3-4cm
* Particular care must be taken around the gap where the blade disappears
* Hold workpiece tight, pressing the workpiece firmly into the table, push at a steady rate through the blade
* Only work on pieces you can safely hold by yourself. If it's too large, ask for another member's help to hold the material
* Keep your hands out of the cutline at all times
* Keep work in contact with table or stops. Do not freehand above the surface. Elevated parts will be grabbed by the blade
* Make sure the workpiece is supported e.g. pieces with overhangs or circular pieces
* Don't force the blade to cut a small radius curve. If this is required make it with multiple small cuts
* Never back out of a radius cut while the machine is running
* Do not leave the machine running unattended
* Have a wide/stable stance
* If the workpiece gets stuck in the blade, stop the machine and gently remove the piece

### Materials

* Acceptable materials include:
  * Wood
  * Aluminium
  * Mild steel
  * Copper
  * Plastic
* Unacceptable materials include:
  * Stainless steel
  * Hardened steel
* Consult the complete list of materials on the wiki page and ask a maintainer if you are unsure of suitability

### Post Cutting

* Once you have finished your cut, turn off the bandsaw, log out of the access control, and clean up the table

## Maintenance

### General

* If there are any issues, please contact a maintainer listed on the bandsaw wiki page. Example issues: damaged blade, blade out of alignment or terrible noises from moving parts

## Other

* The table can tilt but as we do not yet have suitable stops, this table shall stay flat
