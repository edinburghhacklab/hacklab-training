### PPE

* Safety Glasses
* Wear sensible clothing
  * Closed toe shoes
  * Trousers
  * T-shirt

### Risks

<!-- Usually, all of the control measures in the risk assessment should be mentioned here -->

* in rare occasions needles can shatter
  * When this occurs, turn off the machine, and remove fragments from within and around the machine.
  * The machine can pivot backwards to reveal the inside allowing for easier access.
* Getting caught in the machine is a risk, however when properly guiding the material you should never be in a position where this is likely to happen.

### Entanglement risks

* No loose clothing or cables
* No loose jewellery (e.g. watches)
* No gloves
* Long hair must be tied back

## Startup checks

### Thread the machine and bobbin if required

* See manual (Hosted on Wiki) for documentation or ask a maintainer

### Check the bobbin case is correctly installed

* See manual (Hosted on Wiki) for documentation or ask a maintainer

### Check the needle and change/replace if needed

* The needle should be sharp and not bent
  * The needle should be fairly quiet when piercing the fabric, check by manually wheeling the machine and checking the force required and noise produced.
* See manual (Hosted on Wiki) for documentation or ask a maintainer

## Usage

### Starting the machine

* Tap your tag on the access control box
* Turn on machine using switch

### Stopping the machine

* Turn off machine using switch
* Log out using the button on the access control box

### General

* Keep your hands to the sides of the path of the needle, and never in front.
* Don't pull/push the material through the machine, you only need to guide it.
  * For turns, you can use apply drag to one side of the fabric and it will pivot around that point, this achieves very smooth turns.
* Use an appropriate needle for the material.
  * Switch the needle to a leather needle for Vinyl, Leather and other non woven, knit or felted materials.
* Have your foot off the pedal when manually turning the machine or touching needle/bobbin.
* Be aware of how fast the machine
* Do not leave machine running unattended.

### Materials

* Almost all fabrics are good, high-stretch fabrics can be used however the machine may struggle with them. Prefer to use a domestic sewing machine for those as they can achieve greater quality.
* If in doubt, contact a maintainer

### Cleaning up

* Remove all fabric scraps from the machine, and clean dust that has been created by the fabric.
* Put thread trimmer on the hook.
* Opening the sewing machine to access the interior for cleaning.

## Maintenance

### General

* Changing Needles
* Cleaning inside and around the machine

## Other

* Chainging Oil
  * This only needs done if the oil gets excessively dirty, this has never actually been needed, and probably won't be for a good few years.
  * Drain oil bath, and fill to `MAX` line with appropriate oil
