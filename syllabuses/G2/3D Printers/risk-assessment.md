### Likelihood

L

### Risk rating

L

### Who may be harmed & how

- User - the user may have a minor burn due to the high temperature of the hotplate and hot-end of the 3D printer

### Control measures

- Signage - standard "hot surface" signage is used to indicate the surface may be hot
- Training - informing the user about how to tell if the printer is currently operating, checking the current temperature,
  and to avoid touching the hot plate or hot-end directly
- Equipment - first aid kit is available

### Who may be harmed & how

- The space - the equipment and surrounding area may become damaged from a fire started by a flammable material placed
  on the hotplate or hot-end of the 3D printer.
- User - the user may become injured from a fire by both heat and inhalation of smoke
- Bystanders - bystanders may become injured by both heat and inhalation of smoke

### Control measures

- Signage - standard "hot surface" signage is used to indicate the surface may be hot
- Training - users are instructed to not leave flammable materials on or around the 3D printer
- Supervision - active 3D printers are monitored during operation
- Equipment - fire alarms and extinguishers are installed, first aid kit is available

### Who may be harmed & how

- User - the user may experience injuries such as cuts and stretch or crush injuries

### Control measures

- Signage - standard "pinch point" or "crush hazard" signage is used to indicate the printers are hazardous
- Training - users are instructed to remove or secure loose clothing and long hair and to avoid placing hands near

### Risk rating

L

### Who may be harmed & how

- Users of the room - anyone in the room may sustain injury from inhalation of hazardous gasses produced by heated
  thermoplastics

### Control measures

- Enclosure - 3D printer is enclosed in a case to prevent hazardous gasses from escaping
- Extraction - an extraction device is installed to extract hazardous gasses from the enclosure
- Training - users are informed about which plastics produce hazardous gasses and to ensure the enclosure is closed
  and the extraction device operational
