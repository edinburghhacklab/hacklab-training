# Small Laser Cutter

## Safety

### Materials

* Can catch fire (laser cutter must not be left unattended)
* Can produce toxic fumes

### Laser

* High-power laser can cause burns, severe eye damage or blindness
* Laser compartment must remain closed, and the lid-sensor must not be bypassed

### Electricity

* Mains 240V inside control panel
* High voltages (2kV) in control panel and around laser tube

### Lid

* Do not operate if the lid doesn't stay open on its own

## Startup checks

### Enclosure is intact and access panel is closed

* Check the laser enclosure and viewing window isn't damaged
* Check the access panel is locked closed

## Usage

### Hazards

* The laser can cause burns and blindness
* The laser compartment must remain closed, and the lid-sensor must not be bypassed
* The laser cutter contains high voltages (2kV, 240V) and users must keep clear
  of the wiring in the laser compartment and control panel
* There is a risk of fire with **any** material and the laser cutter must not be
  left unattended, even for a minute (there is pause button and an emergency stop)

### Starting of the machine

* Check there are no obstacles for when the laser cutter moves to the home position
* Tap your tag on the access control
* Ensure the external extractor fan is running
* Release the E-Stop
* Power on the machine (key switch)
* Ensure the internal air pump is running (unless cutting paper)

### General

* Know how to power-up the cutter and check that the extraction, water
  cooling and air assist are working
* Know which materials may be cut safely, that some plastics may produce
  chlorine or cyanide gases, and that some materials may catch fire more easily
  than others
* Know that the cutter works best with coolant temperature between 10-20C,
  should not usually be used above 25C, and how to check the temperature
* Basic use of the software
* Setting appropriate power/speeds for different materials
* Using the cutter's control panel to move the head/carriage (don't move it
  outside the allowed area because there is no protection against this)
* Positioning the workpiece and setting Z (vertical) alignment
  * The 60cm alignment tool should be placed on the material at the left of the
    laser head/carriage and be made flush with the top of it
* Using the test button before cutting (the red light indicates the outer
  boundary of the cutting/engraving area)

### Materials

* Acceptable materials include:
  * Acrylic
  * Laser safe plywood
  * Laser safe silicone rubber
  * Laser safe vinyl
  * Paper/cardboard
  * PLA (short cuts only)
* Unacceptable materials include:
  * Metal
* Consult the complete list of materials on the wiki page
* Ask a maintainer if you are unsure of suitability

### Stopping of the machine

* The E-stop should be pressed in an emergency, this will cut power to the laser
* Return the laser to the home position ("Datum" button)
* Power off the machine (red button/key switch)
* Remember to log out if leaving the machine unattended for any period of time

### Post Cutting/Engraving

* Once you have finished your work, turn off the laser cutter, log out of the access control, and clean up the bed
* Leave the machine in the state you would expect to find it

## Maintenance

### Basic (mandatory)

#### Removing dirt and debris

* Remove large debris by hand
* Use vacuum cleaner to remove small debris

### Intermediate (optional)

* Cleaning mirrors and lens
* Checking alignment of laser
* Minor corrections of alignment (mirrors 2 and 3 only)

#### Checking alignment of visible guide laser

Don't do this unless the guide laser is obviously wrong because it will wear
out the screw holding the guide laser in the aligned position.

1. Put scrap material in the laser cutter and focus
2. Close the lid
3. Briefly press and release the "Laser" button to fire the laser
4. Open the lid
5. Align the guide laser with the mark on the material

### Advanced (optional)

* Removal of bed for extended cleaning
* Full alignment
* Replacement of laser tube
